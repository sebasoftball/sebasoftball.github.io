<h3>Rules of Association</h3>
	
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The SEBA Softball League, hereafter called
  the League, shall be governed by a Board of Managers made up of the manager
  from each team and the non-voting (except in the case of a tie) league
  Commissioner, who shall act as Chairman, and a non-voting SEBA liaison.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The Board of Managers shall meet as needed
  and as called for by the Chairman.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The rules shall be reviewed each year and
  may only be revised before the start of the regular season. If the rules need
  to be amended during the season due to a special situation, then a unanimous
  decision is required for the vote to be approved.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>All decisions by the Board of Managers shall
  be decided by a simple majority vote of the Board members or their assigns.
  In case of a tie vote, the Chairman shall cast the deciding vote. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>A quorum shall be more than one-half the
  Board members. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The Board of Managers is the sole authority
  for changes in rules, schedules, or any other decision affecting play in the
  league. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>A commissioner will be elected by the Board
  of Managers at the beginning of each season. <u>Any</u> SEBA member is
  eligible to run for commissioner. If the elected commissioner is also a
  coach, then the coaching duties should be passed off to someone else on the
  team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>An assistant commissioner may be elected by
  the Board of Managers at the beginning of each season. Any SEBA member is

  <h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ground Rules<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Safety is a primary interest in setting
  ground rules for this league. Therefore, the abrogation of these rules by
  mutual consent of the managers and/or the umpire will not be tolerated.</span></b><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Suspended Games:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Umpires are encouraged to suspend games when thunder
  or lightning are in the area or when it becomes too dark to continue a game
  safely. Games suspended will be continued at a later date from the point in
  the game when it was suspended. Managers should re-create the lineups as
  closely as possible with the players available at the continuation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Out-of-Play-Line:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The lines parallel to the foul lines and extended
  from the side fences are to be considered Out-of- Play-Lines. Overthrows are
  out of play when they cross these lines either by rolling or on the fly.
  Runners get two bases from the last Base attained at the time of the throw. A
  thrown ball which is caught in play and then carried out of play is NOT an
  overthrow (see Balls Carried Out of Play).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Batted Balls crossing Out-of-Play-Line:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A batted ball that is fair but crosses the
  Out-of-Play-Line before a fielder fields the ball is considered a
  &quot;Ground Rule Double&quot;. The Umpire shall call &quot;Dead Ball. Out of
  Play&quot; and award the batter 2nd Base. Any runners on base are awarded two
  bases from the base they were on when the ball was hit. A batted ball that
  crosses the Out-of-Play-Line and is foul is considered out of play. As soon
  as the ball crosses the line, the umpire shall call &quot;Out of Play&quot;
  and fielders shall not make any attempt to field the ball. The ball is
  considered a foul ball strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Fair balls:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Balls that are fair but hit deer, geese, etc. shall
  be declared a dead ball and not count. All runners shall return to the base
  they were on before the pitch and the batter shall receive another pitch with
  the previous count. Balls that are fair but hit trees remain in play but are
  not outs if caught before hitting the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Balls Carried Out of Play:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A ball is said to be carried out of play by a
  fielder when a fielder in possession and control of the ball steps into an
  out of play area. As soon as this occurs, the umpire should call &quot;dead
  ball&quot; Any runners should advance to the next base. If the umpire
  determines that the ball was carried out of play intentionally by the
  fielder, the runners may advance two bases from the last base attained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Bunts and Altered Swings:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A batter that bunts a ball is &quot;out&quot; and <b>must</b>
  be called so by the umpire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>A Batted Ball Coming to Rest on the Foul
  Line</span></u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'> is <b>fair</b> and <b>must</b>
  be called so by the umpire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Leading-Off Base and Stealing:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A base runner may not leave the base until the ball
  crosses home plate or is hit by the batter. A <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span>
  may not steal a base except during an appeal to the umpire. Any <span
  class=SpellE>baserunner</span> leading-off or stealing is &quot;out&quot; and
  must be called so by the umpire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
	
  <h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Reminders<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Safety Rules:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> This is a brief synopsis of the rules regarding
  collisions between <span class=SpellE>baserunners</span> and fielders. For
  more detail see <a
  href="http://www.playnsa.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=7"><span
  style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>the Official National
  Softball Association (NSA) Softball Rule book.</span></a> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Rule (1993a): <u>Runners</u> are to avoid
  all collisions. When the fielder has the ball, runners either give themselves
  up by running out of the way, or they can slide into the base (not through
  the base). If the catcher does not have the ball and the runner beats the
  throw but misses home trying avoid the fielder, then the runner is safe. This
  rule supersedes all &quot;rule book&quot; rules. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>A <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span>,
  seeing that the fielder has the ball and is going to attempt to make a tag,
  must either slide or &quot;give himself/herself up&quot; he may not &quot;run
  over&quot; or otherwise, in the judgment of the umpiring, intentionally
  collide with the fielder for the purpose of jarring the ball loose. If the
  umpire determines that the collision was intentional, the <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span>
  will be called out and in some instances maybe ejected from the game. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>A fielder may not make a &quot;fake&quot;
  tag for the purpose of making a <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span> slow
  down, slide, or stop. If he does so, the umpire may award the <span
  class=SpellE>baserunner</span> additional bases and in some cases (e.g., the <span
  class=SpellE>baserunner</span> slides and is injured) the fielder may be
  ejected from the game. The &quot;fake&quot; tag is considered unsportsmanlike
  conduct. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Plays at Home Plate:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Perhaps more than at any other base, plays at home
  plate should be governed by the Safety Rules. Injuries due to
  &quot;unnecessary roughness&quot; <b>WILL NOT</b> be tolerated by the league.
  The strike mat is considered to be an extension of the plate for the runner
  when there is a play at the plate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Obstruction:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The only times that a fielder has the right to
  position himself between a runner and the base to which the runner is going
  is when <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  </span></span></span><![endif]><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:

  margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><![if !supportLists]><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
  style='mso-list:Ignore'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span></span><![endif]><span style='font-size:9.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:
  "Times New Roman"'>The fielder is fielding a <b>batted</b> ball.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Note that in the second case, the runner is
  not required to run in the base path unless an attempt to tag him is being
  made. If the runner is able to avoid the fielder he must do so. On the other
  hand, a fielder may not station himself in the base path ahead of time,
  claiming he is fielding the ball when it is reasonably possible to field the
  ball without obstructing the runner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>If, <u>in the judgment of the umpire</u> a
  fielder obstructs a <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span>, the umpire
  immediately signals &quot;OBSTRUCTION&quot; by extending his left fist
  straight out to the side, but no call is made until the play is over. When
  the play is over, the umpire may award to any runners any additional bases
  that, in the umpire's judgment, they would have obtained had no obstruction
  occurred. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>For example: the first baseman obstructs the
  batter as he rounds first base. The umpire signals &quot;OBSTRUCTION&quot;
  The runner continues to run but is tagged out going into third base. The umpire
  may overrule the out call and award the runner third (or even home) if in his
  opinion the runner would have made it had the obstruction not occurred. If,
  however, the runner is thrown out at third and the umpire (even though he has
  signaled &quot;OBSTRUCTION&quot; determines that the runner would not
  normally have attained third, the umpire may let the out call stand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Interference:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Interference can be thought of as sort of the
  opposite of obstruction. There are basically two situations when interference
  can be called: when a <span class=SpellE>baserunner</span> <b>intentionally</b>
  interferes with a fielder fielding a batted ball, and when a <span
  class=SpellE>baserunner</span> <b>intentionally</b> positions himself in the
  path of a thrown ball. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>In both situations, the runner is
  immediately called &quot;out&quot; In the both situations, the umpire may
  also call other runners &quot;out&quot; if in his opinion they would have
  been out had the interference not occurred. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>For example. With a runner on first, the
  batter hits a ground ball to the shortstop who fields it and throws to the
  second baseman for the force at second. The second baseman then throws toward
  first to attempt to make the double play. The runner from first, however,
  sticks out his hand and knocks the ball down. The umpire may also call the
  batter out at first base. In addition, had the runner not actually hit the
  ball, but instead only made the second baseman &quot;start&quot; or pause for
  an instant, the umpire may still call the batter out at first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Double First Base:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> On ground balls hit in the infield where there is a
  possible play at first the batter should use the outside (orange colored) bag
  when running to first. This is to prevent any collisions between the batter
  and first baseman. On balls hit to the outfield the batter should use the
  inside bag when rounding first. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Equipment Bins:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> After the game, the bases and any other balls, bats,
  bases, etc. that came out of the equipment bin should be returned to the
  equipment bin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Trash:</span></u><span style='font-size:
  9.0pt'> Please place all trash in trash cans after game. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Rainouts:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> All effort should be made to play the games when
  they are originally scheduled. Please do not be too hasty in
  &quot;calling&quot; a game. If a game is &quot;called&quot;, it should be
  reschedule as soon as possible. It is advised that you check with the
  Commissioner for available dates for make-ups. When a new date is agreed
  upon, you must inform the Commissioner and the team that is to provide the
  umpire. In some cases, when necessary, the Commissioner may make a new
  umpiring assignment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Setting up the field:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The home team shall be responsible for setting up
  and cleaning up the field before and after each game. The duties include
  setting out the bases and strike mat as well as making sure that there is
  enough dirt around the bases. After the game, the duties include placing the
  bases and strike mat back into the Equipment bin and placing the base plugs
  back into the slots in the infield, and hand dragging the infield.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
	
  <h3><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>League Rules of
  Play<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The Official <a
  href="http://www.playnsa.com/"><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:
  none'>National Softball Association</span></a> (NSA) &quot;General <span
  class=SpellE>Slowpitch</span> Softball Playing Rules&quot; shall be the
  guideline for any situation not specifically covered herein. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The No-Contest Rule:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The game is over if one team has a lead of 15 or
  more runs after 5 innings (4 innings if the home team is leading). The umpire
  is excused, and any further play is regarded as practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The No-Contest Rule addendum (2013</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'>): If a team is ahead by 15 or more runs before 5
  innings have been played, the team that is ahead is limited to scoring 10
  additional runs per inning until such time as the team that is behind is able
  to come within 15 runs later in the game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Minimum Arc on Pitches:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> All pitches must attain a minimum height of 6' from
  the ground. The umpire does not call the pitch illegal until after the
  catcher has the ball. (From currently adopted rule book. Amended '93) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Maximum Arc on Pitches:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The maximum arc on pitches is 10' from the ground. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Strike Mat:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A strike mat will be used to determine balls and
  strikes. Any pitched ball that touches any part of the strike mat is a
  strike; otherwise, the pitch is a ball. Catchers must therefore allow pitches
  to hit the mat in order to obtain a strike call. The plate is not considered
  part of the strike mat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Third Strike Rule:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> After a batter has two strikes, any ball not fairly
  hit is considered the third strike and is recorded as a strikeout unless the
  game is being played as a fast play game. (See Fast Game Play) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>The Encroachment Line</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> is an arc inscribed in the outfield which is 165 <span
  class=SpellE>ft</span> from the point of home plate. No more than 6 defensive
  players, including the catcher, may be within the line at the time the ball
  is pitched. If 6 defensive players are inside the line, one must be the pitcher
  and one must be the catcher. If more than the maximum number of defensive
  players is within the line at the time when the ball crosses the plate and
  the ball is hit, the batter may elect to take either the result of the hit or
  an automatic walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Bats:</span></u><span style='font-size:
  9.0pt'> A legal bat is one that has been approved by the National Softball
  Association (NSA). It shall be illegal for any player to use a bat that has
  not been approved by the NSA. It is the responsibility of the each manager to
  make sure that illegal bats are not being used by his/her team. It is the
  umpires' duty to enforce this rule. If umpire determines a bat to be illegal
  prior to a batter getting a hit then the batter is given opportunity to
  change to a legal bat. If illegal bat is used and a hit occurs with the bat
  then batter is considered out. Any runners on base must return to base they
  were at prior to hit. If it is unclear whether a bat is legal/illegal then
  the bat in questioned shall be considered illegal until final ruling by
  commissioner prior to next game. The list of approved bats is located on the
  NSA web site at <a
  href="https://www.playnsa.com/PrintableBatList.aspx">https://www.playnsa.com/PrintableBatList.aspx</a>.
  If a dispute occurs that requires the intervention of the commissioner, the
  list on the web site will supersede any list printed and displayed at the
  softball fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Minimum Playing Time:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Any player on a team's roster who arrives at a game
  before the beginning of the game, and wants to play, shall have the
  opportunity of 2 at-bats or 1 at- bat and 3 innings in the field. Exceptions
  may occur if the bottom of the 7th inning is not played or if the No-Contest
  rule is invoked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Minimum Number of Players Needed to Start
  a Game:</span></u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'> A team must have a minimum
  of eight (8) players. No players will be provided by the opposing team to
  make the minimum of eight. The game will begin at the later of &quot;game
  time&quot; (see Schedule section) or when both teams have at least eight
  players. If a team has fewer than eight players at the &quot;forfeit
  time&quot; (see Schedule section), they must forfeit the game. If it appears
  that either of the teams is stalling in order to allow more players to arrive
  before starting the game, the umpire shall begin calling &quot;balls&quot;
  (if the team in the field is stalling) or &quot;strikes&quot; (if the team at
  bat is stalling) every 15 seconds until the team stalling takes a position
  ready to play. If both teams are stalling, the umpire will alternate calls of
  &quot;balls&quot; and &quot;strikes&quot; beginning with &quot;strikes.&quot;
  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>If a team falls below eight players due to
  injury or any other reason, they may be replaced first by any normal
  substitution, then by any roster member present (whether he/she has been in
  the game yet or not). If no other roster members are available, the team must
  forfeit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Maximum Number of Players in the Lineup:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> A lineup may consist of up to twelve (12) players,
  10 defensive positions plus 2 additional offensive positions. At any time
  during the game, any 10 of the up to 12 players may take defensive positions
  (including switching in the middle of an inning) without change to the
  lineup. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>If a lineup becomes smaller due to injury or
  any other reason the player may be replaced first by any normal substitution,
  then by any roster member present (whether he/she has been in the game yet or
  not). If no substitutes are available, the position in the batting order is
  skipped; there is no penalty. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Starting a Game at Less Than Maximum
  Strength:</span></u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'> If a team starts a game
  with less than 10 players, they may, as more players arrive, add them to the
  lineup at any time (including into defensive positions in the middle of an
  inning). If enough players are present, the team must have at least 10
  players in the lineup. If enough players become available to include any DH
  positions, they must be immediately added to the lineup or the team forfeits
  the right to those positions. Any players added are placed at the bottom of
  the batting order. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>For example. A team starts the game with
  eight players. Part way through the first inning, while the team is in the
  field, another players arrives. The player must be added to the bottom of the
  batting order and may immediately take a position in the field. A short while
  later, two more players arrive. The manager must put one of them in the
  lineup right away. The second player need not be added to the lineup
  immediately, however, if he is not, the team may not use a DH for the
  remainder of the game. If he is also added, if a fourth player arrives, the
  manager also has the option of adding this player to the lineup as a second
  DH. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Any team with less than 9 players and more
  than the minimum number of players will be provided a catcher from the other
  team for the sole purpose of throwing the ball back to the pitcher after each
  pitch. The complimentary catcher shall have no other responsibilities for the
  opposing team and may function in a full capacity for his/her own team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Re-Entry Rule:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Starters who have been replaced in the lineup by
  substitutes may re-enter the game in any position in the lineup provided that
  that position has appeared at the plate since the starter left the game. A
  player may only re-enter the game once. Substitutes that are subsequently
  replaced by yet another substitute, may not re-enter the game except as noted
  in the rules regarding injuries and minimum number of players. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Umpiring Assignments:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> The team scheduled to umpire a game must provide at
  least two (2) umpires who should arrive prior to &quot;game time&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Penalty for Forfeits and Missed Umpiring
  Assignments:</span></u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'> This league depends on
  the cooperation of all its teams and players. One of the reasons that the
  league has continued to survive after many years in a basically unchanged
  format is that it has continued to have enough conscientious participants
  available to perform the sometimes unenviable task of umpiring a game. In
  order for the league to continue this level of participation must not wane.
  In the long run, then, the penalty for not providing an umpire could well be
  the collapse of the league. In light of that, the short term penalties must
  necessarily be as severe: any combination of missed umpiring assignments and
  forfeits adding up to 3, will automatically eliminate a team from the
  post-season tournament. A team thus determined ineligible may make an appeal
  through the Commissioner to the Board of Managers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>An excessive number of forfeits and missed
  umpiring assignments could result in the elimination of the team, as an
  entity, from the league. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Suspension:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> When a player is ejected from a game for any reason,
  it is the umpire's responsibility to notify, in writing, the Commissioner
  including the date, the name of the player, the team for which he plays, the
  name of the opposing team, and the incident for which the player was ejected.
  The Board shall review all ejections as soon as possible to determine if any
  other punitive action is warranted. The person that was ejected has the right
  to appear at, and bring witnesses to, the review in his own behalf. The
  player may continue to play until a decision is reached by the Board. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><u><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>Protests:</span></u><span
  style='font-size:9.0pt'> Protests are not generally allowed. Protests are
  handled by a &quot;Protest Board&quot; consisting of the Managers of the
  teams not involved. The Protest Board reserves the right to correct the
  umpire's mistake and at its discretion may order the game to be continued
  from the point of the mistake. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>If a protest is going to be made, the
  following steps must be adhered to: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  Board and must be approved by more than one-half the Protest Board members. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
