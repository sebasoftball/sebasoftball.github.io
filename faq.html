<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>General Questions</h2>
<p class="question">Who is eligible to play?</p>
<p class="answer">Any SEBA Member is eligible to play. This can include all NIST permanent and contract employees and their immediate family (husband, wife, son, daughter). For the complete list of who is eligible, visit the <a href="http://www.govemployee.com/seba/Join.html">SEBA Membership</a> page.</p>

<p class="question">I want to play. How can I join a team?</p>
<p class="answer">You can either contact a <a href="teams.aspx">manager</a> on an existing team or you can contact the <a href="mailto:<%=CommishEmail%>">league commissioner</a>.</p>

<p class="question">I don't have after hours access to the NIST Campus and am worried that I will have to leave games early.  Is there any way to be able to stay for the whole game?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. Your coach can get a SEBA Softball Visitors Pass for you that will give you permission leave the campus on your own after games. While you are waiting for your visitors pass, any of your teammates that have after hours access can escort you off the campus.</p>

<p class="question">What is the level of play in the league?</p>
<p class="answer">It varies from team to team. Some teams are competitive while others are social. But overall it is a &quot;C&quot; level work league. Often times some of the players from the teams will go out to a local restaurant for dinner after the games.</p>

<p class="question">Where are the fields?</p>
<p class="answer">See map. Look for the blue numbers 1 &amp; 2. The fields are located past the picnic grove across from the Administrative Building and are adjacent to I-270. <a href="map.gif"><img src="map.gif" alt="Campus map of NIST" align="top" width="100" height="80"></a></p>

<p class="question">How can playing softball help me meet other people at NIST?</p>
<p class="answer">In addition to meeting people by playing in games together, the SEBA Softball League tries to foster a social atmosphere.  Teams are encouraged to interact outside of games.  Some examples of these interactions include: BBQs in the picnic grove after the game, going out to dinner after the game, the league sponsored lunch during the tournament, league sponsored batting practices before the season, etc.  These and other activities are great ways to interact with other people from NIST and learn what else goes on at NIST.</p>

<p class="question">Is there an end of year tournament?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes. All teams make the double elimination tournament and seedings are based on regular season standings.</p>

<p class="question">Is there a trophy to be won?</p>
<p class="answer">The SEBA Championship Trophy (not to be confused with the Stanley Cup).</p>

<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p class="question">How long is the season?</p>
<p class="answer">The season usually lasts from May to August/September depending on the year.  Before each season starts, the coaches create and vote on a schedule for the league.  Please visit  <a href="schedule.asp">this year's schedule</a> for this years game dates.  From this year's schedule, you can find older season schedules as well.</p>

<p class="question">After the winter I am sure to be rusty, does the league do anything to help me get ready?</p>
<p class="answer">Yes.  Usually the league organizes batting practice sessions during April that anyone in the league can participate in.</p>

<p class="question">How many games are played per week?</p>
<p class="answer">Usually 1 to 2 games a week and no more than 3 games every two weeks.</p>

<p class="question">When are the games played?</p>
<p class="answer">Usually on Tuesday, and Thursday. Games start at 5:45 p.m. and last about an hour and a quarter.</p>

<p class="question">Do I have to play in every game?</p>
<p class="answer">No.  The league recognizes that frequently NIST Staff has other work commitments (travel, experiments running late, etc.) and personal commitments.  Therefore the league is very flexible in game attendace.  The only requirement of attendance is that you must participate in at least one-third of your team's games to be eligible for the end of the year tournament.</p>

<p class="question">How many innings are the games?</p>
<p class="answer">Games are 7 innings long unless the No-Contest Rule is needed.</p>

<p class="question">What is the No-Contest Rule?</p>
<p class="answer">The game is over if one team has a lead of 15 or more runs after 5 innings (4 innings if the home team is leading). The umpire is excused, and any further play is regarded as practice.</p>

<p class="question">Do all at bats start with a 1-1 count?</p>
<p class="answer">No. Batters start with a 0-0 count in games that are played under the normal rules.  A batter needs 4 balls for a walk or 3 strikes for a strikeout.</p>

<p class="question">Wow, so if I get 3 strikes, then I can just keep fouling off pitches until I get one I like, right?</p>
<p class="answer">Not quite... In games played under the normal rules, the batter must hit the ball in fair territory when he/she has two strikes.  A foul ball with two strikes is considered the third strike.  This is called the "Third Strike Rule".</p>

<p class="question">What is a courtesy foul?</p>
<p class="answer">In games played under Fast Game Play rules, there are times that a batter is allowed to have one foul ball with a two strike count.  Please see <a href="rules.aspx">the rules for Fast Game Play</a> for details on when this is applicable.</p>
