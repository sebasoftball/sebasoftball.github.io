The 2nd through the 6th seeds are still in question. 2 through 4 will go to GRA, SB, and CBT where GRA has the head-to-head tie breaker over SB, SB has the tie breaker over CBT, and CBT the tie breaker over GRA. The 5th and 6th seeds will go to OCB and ET, where ET has the tie breaker for runs scored in head-to-head games (1-1, but ET outscored OCB 31-27). NCNR is the 7 seed.  It should be an exciting final week!  The <a href="scheduletournament.asp">tournament schedule</a> for 2019 has been updated.</p>

<p class="SeasonArticle">The <a href="scheduletournament.asp">schedule for the tournament</a> has been posted with the teams shown based on their seedings.  It should print onto one landscaped page.  Games start on Tuesday!  Good luck to all!</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">Top Seeds Clinched</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">Congratulations to the OC Bombers who have clinched the #1 seed in the tournament and Entropic Thunder who has clinched the #2 seed.  There are still close races for the 3 & 4 seeds as well as the 5, 6, & 7 seeds.</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">July 28 Games</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle"><span style="font-style:italic">(Updated 4:05 PM)</span> It has started raining again in Gaithersburg.  Games are cancelled for tonight.  The storm to the west combined with the storm that had popped up in Rockville and it looks like the rain free gap that was expected will be filled with rain.  In fact, I just saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177971/">George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg</a> sail by saying something about setting the fish market in the morning.</p>
<p class="SeasonArticle"><span style="font-style:italic">(Updated 3:42 PM)</span> It has rained in Gaithersburg.  The rain may let up within the next 20 minutes or so.  I think that 90 minutes will be enough time for the fields to dry out or for the water to run off.  Next update should be shortly after 4 PM.</p>
<p class="SeasonArticle"><span style="font-style:italic">(Updated 3:09 PM)</span> Games are currently on.  It looks like the storms will be passing to our north and that if we are hit with a storm before game time, it will pass quickly.  With the fields being so dry, they should also recover quickly.  The web site will be updated if the status of games changes.</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">July 21 Games</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">It is going to be hot for the games today.  Make sure to drink plenty of water!  If anyone at the games runs out of water, you can get a refill from the water cooler on the Chemistry bench on Field 1.</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">June 23 Games Postponed</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">All games for June 23 have been postponed.  Both fields currently have standing water with little chance that they will dissipate and be dry by game time.  Also, the best chance for thunderstorms this evening is at 6 PM.  The coaches will work to get the games rescheduled.</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">The SEBA Softball Web Site is back!  Sort of...</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">It has been five years since the SEBA Softball league has had a web site.  This year we are bringing it back.  Information about the teams, schedules, standings will be updated here.  At the moment, the top level pages are working.  Games status will be updated on the web site in case of inclement weather.  I'll post updates as different parts of the site come back online.  If anyone is interested in helping with the upkeep of the web site, please let Dinis Camara know.</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">Who's the Boss? Part 2</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">Since Doug Meier has left NIST for another job, we are in need of a new commissioner.  <a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/wwwph/cso.nist.gov?Query=camara_2">Dinis Camara</a> has volunteered to reprise his role as commissioner for one year so that the season can go on.  However, we need someone to step up and volunteer to be the next commissioner.  Ideally, that person can be the assistant commissioner for the year to learn the ins and outs of what needs to be done.  Please let Dinis or your coach know if you are willing to help out.  (Not sure of the reference in the header?  Check out the stories from the 2010 season.)</p>

<h2 class="SeasonHeader">2011 Season</h2>
<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">May 10 - Opening Day!</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">The 2011 Season starts May 10!</p>

<h2 class="SeasonHeader">2010 Season</h2>
<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">August 5 - Games On!</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">The rain that moved through last hour left the fields in playable condition.  There are storms currently in West Virginia associated with a cold front that are coming our way.  However, we are on the upper limit of the storms.  Looking at the radar, they might go just south of us in which case we can get all the games in.  If not, then they will probably roll in just before 7.  (The front edge of the storm is just rain, not severe weather.)  In addition, the pathway between Field 1 and the 101 Parking Lot has been reopened.  So the teams on field 1 would be able to get to their cars quickly in the case that storms roll in.  Also, both fields were mowed today.  (There are some clumps of cut grass in the outfields.)  Plant said that they will be trying to work on the growth on the infields over the weekend.
</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">Storm Damage (7/25) Doesn't Affect The Fields</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">Doug has received phone confirmation from Bruce Connelly at Grounds Maintenance that the picnic grove damage, while extensive, doesn�t extend to the fields.  For Field 1 access we�ll just have to walk the long way around.  It is recommended that you park your car in the Building 222 Parking Lot.  So, barring a surprise 5:30 thunderstorm, field conditions will not be effected by the storm damage, and we�re likely playing today.  Real call still goes out at 3 PM, so watch this space!</p>

<div class="SeasonArticleHeader">Help Needed!</div>
<p class="SeasonArticle">The new equipment bins are in but need to be set up.  If you can assist in setting up the bins, please contact <a href="http://www-i.nist.gov/cgi-bin/wwwph/www-i.nist.gov?Query=douglas+meier">Doug Meier</a>.  thank you to Rod Ibacache and Renee Bolden of SEBA for helping to get our new equipment sheds approved and ordered.  I also want to thank Jim Fort (NIST-Fits), Matt Bolden (OCB), Patrick Gleichmann (Quantum Fielders) and Yooyoung Lee (Quantum Fielders) for assistance at various stages of assembly.  Hopefully we should have them up and ready by the end of this week.</p>
